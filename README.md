# AUTOMATIC-DETECTION-OF-HATE-SPEECH-IN-SOCIAL_MEDIA-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
This project focuses on implementing a deep learning system for text classification, specifically aimed at detecting hate speech and offensive language on social media platforms. It leverages context-independent word embedding techniques, such as word2vec, GloVe, and FastText, in conjunction with BiLSTM, a variant of RNN models.
